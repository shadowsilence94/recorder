Web-Based Speech Training RecorderA zero-installation, browser-based application for recording speech data for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) projects. This tool is inspired by the original Python-based recorder from LU Lab, Myanmar, and re-imagines it as a modern, accessible web application.This application allows users to upload a script, record themselves reading the prompts, and export the collected audio and metadata in a structured format, ready for model training. All processing and storage happens directly in your browser, ensuring privacy and simplicity.FeaturesZero Installation: Runs entirely in any modern web browser. No need to install Python, libraries, or any other dependencies.Prompt File Upload: Start a session by simply uploading a .txt file containing your recording prompts (one per line).Flexible Prompting Modes:Random: Presents prompts in a random order.Ordered: Presents prompts sequentially from the file and stops at the end.Sequential: Presents prompts in order and loops back to the beginning.In-Browser Recording: Uses the browser's MediaRecorder API to capture high-quality audio from your microphone.Persistent Sessions: Automatically saves your progress (recorded files and prompts) in the browser's local storage (IndexedDB).Resume Sessions: If you close the browser and return, you will be prompted to resume your previous session, picking up where you left off.One-Click Export: Package your entire recording session—all .wav audio files and a recordings.tsv metadata file—into a single .zip archive for easy download.Fully Responsive: The user interface is designed with Tailwind CSS to be fully functional and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.How to UseGet the File: Save the application code as a single recorder.html file on your computer.Open in Browser: Open the recorder.html file in a modern web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).Configure Your Session:In the "1. Configuration" section, click "Upload Prompt File" to select your .txt script.Choose your preferred "Prompt Selection Mode".Click "Start Session".Record Audio:The first prompt will be displayed.Click "Start Recording". Your browser will ask for microphone permission the first time. You must click "Allow".Read the prompt aloud, then click "Stop Recording".Review and Save:You can click "Play Last" to listen to your recording.If you are happy with it, click "Save". The recording will be added to the "Session Files" list, and the application will automatically advance to the next prompt.Export Your Dataset:When you have completed your session, click the "Export Session (.zip)" button.A .zip file will be generated and downloaded, containing your complete dataset.Exported File StructureThe exported .zip file is named tts_session_YYYY-MM-DD.zip and contains the following structure, which is ideal for feeding into model training pipelines:tts_session_2025-06-24.zip
